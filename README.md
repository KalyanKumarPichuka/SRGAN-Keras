## 1. Architecture
The generator creates a high-resolution (HR) image (4x upscaled) from a corresponding low-resolution (LR) image. The discriminator distinguishes the generated (fake) HR images from the original HR images.

(n) and stride (s) indicated for each convolutional layer.

### 1.2. Overview of input / outputs

**Code Overview**: Overview of the three networks; generator, discriminator, and VGG19. Generator create SR image from LR, discriminator predicts whether it's a SR or original HR, and VGG19 extracts features from generated SR and original HR images. 

## 2. Content & Adversarial Loss
<img src='images/loss_equations.PNG' width="80%" />

**Losses Overview**: The perceptual loss is a combination of content loss (based on VGG19 features) and adversarial loss. Equations are taken directly from ["original paper"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802).
